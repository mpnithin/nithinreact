            “The contribution of our batch — in terms of academics, sports and cultural activities — were significant to the growth of CET as a pioneering educational institution in our country. So instead of merely celebrating the golden jubilee year of our batch, we thought of doing something unique and productive for our college. Only through such deeds we can be remembered by our college,” said S Gopakumar, an alumnus of the batch.
